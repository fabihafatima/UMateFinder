Ever had difficulty finding a roommate? Just swipe right and find your perfect match!

UMate is a web application designed to simplify the process of finding compatible roommates. With UMate, users can easily create a profile, set their preferences, and find potential roommates using a swipe interface similar to dating apps. By using a recommendation model, UMate suggests the top matches based on compatibility factors like the duration of stay, lifestyle, budget, dietary preferences, and more.
